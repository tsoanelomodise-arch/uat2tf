              <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                South Africa continues to face deep-rooted inequalities in its economy. Despite decades of Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) policy, many black-owned small, medium, and micro enterprises (SMMEs) still struggle to access meaningful financial resources.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Traditional Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD) programmes are fragmented and uneven in impact: contributions are made across the private sector, but the support often fails to reach those most excluded, particularly in township and rural economies.

              <ul className="highlight-list">
                <li>Lack of coordinated funding mechanisms</li>

              <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The proposed Transformation Fund offers a strong opportunity to change how South Africa finances its economic transformation. By centralising transformation funding, the Fund will combine and use resources from multiple sources such as ESD contributions, Equity Equivalent Investment Programmes (EEIP), public interest commitments and government allocations.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Beyond financing, the Fund will provide a full range of support: debt, equity, grants and guidance all in one place. This means not only investing in enterprises, but also building their capacity, strengthening business models and connecting them to markets.
